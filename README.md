A tiny ml framework with the goal of generating efficient and verifiable compute graphs

Current Goals:

Finish implementing core layers like Linear and ReLU.

Build a simple training loop for a task like XOR or MNIST.

Test the framework end-to-end: forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.

Explore gradient clipping, weight regularization, and other optimization techniques.
